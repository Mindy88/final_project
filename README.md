## **Abstract**
This study aims to investigate the correlation between the public's growing awareness of diseases and changes in the number of new cases of those diseases. Identifying a consistent relationship between increased awareness and fluctuations in the incidence of new cases could enable the development of effective preventive healthcare campaigns and policy initiatives.

For this analysis, approximately 1,200 articles related to diabetes were extracted from Factiva, ensuring the use of reliable resources. The study examines the annual trend in the number of diabetes-related articles and its correlation with the number of new diabetes cases. Furthermore, topic modeling was employed to identify specific themes discussed within the context of diabetes.

Although no clear relationship was found between the public's heightened awareness of diabetes and changes in the number of new cases, the findings suggest a shift in article content — from highly specialized topics to those more closely related to everyday life — as public awareness increased. Further analysis is expected to contribute to the development of strategies aimed at raising public awareness of diseases.
